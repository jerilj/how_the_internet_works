            <strong>Internet service provider provides the network we can connect to and send information. All addresses on
            the internet have a unique address. This address is used to send information to this device. This address is called
            the IP address.</strong> IP addresses with the size of 32 bits are IPv4 and IP addresses with the size of 128 bits are
            IPv6 IP addresses. When a packet is sent to an IP address the address of a DNS server matches names to IP
            addresses. One DNS server is not enough to handle millions of domain names.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            The data is sent through the network as packets. This data is split into packets with a maximum size of 64KB.
            Each packet has a header that has the origin and destination address. The packets are split into
            different parts and each part has the order information. Once the packet is received at the destination, an
            acknowledgement is sent to the sender. If the sender does not receive the acknowledgement it will resend the
            packet. The receiver will put together the packets in order and recreate the data. All packets don't take the
            same path. They take different paths and reach the destination at different times.
        </p>


        <p class="lead">
            Information is sent as bits through the internet. The number of bits that can be sent in a second shows the
            bandwidth. Bits can be sent using electricity, light and radio waves. Fiber optic cables are used to send
            information using light. The information sent from the client machine is routed through different routes by
            routers until it reaches the destination. Each router selects the cheapest route to travel to the
            destination.TCP is the protocol that manages sending and receiving of packets . TCP makes sure all packets are received
            at the destination. If TCP finds packets are missing the sender is notified and the packets will be resend.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            When you type the address of a website in a web browser, the client computer looks up the address on another
            server. Once the http request reaches the destination the destination server responds with an html web page.
            Each part of the web page like images takes another request. A cookie is used to save the information of
            previously accessed webpages.
